# Unveiling-COVID-19-Dynamics-in-India-Through-Excel-Dashboard-Analytics

### **Background:**

In late 2019, the world witnessed the emergence of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which led to the global pandemic of COVID-19. India, with its vast and diverse population, faced unprecedented challenges in managing the spread of the virus. The pandemic brought forth a deluge of data - daily cases, recoveries, deaths, testing rates, and vaccination progress across various states and union territories. This extensive dataset provides a unique opportunity to understand the dynamics of the pandemic in one of the world's most populous countries. Analyzing this data is crucial for policymakers, healthcare providers, and the public to make informed decisions and to prepare for future health crises.

### **Objective:**

The objective of this case study is to provide an in-depth analysis of India's COVID-19 situation through advanced data analytics using Excel. Students are tasked with integrating and interpreting vast datasets encompassing confirmed cases, recoveries, deaths, testing, and vaccination figures across different states and time periods. The key focus is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's trajectory, the effectiveness of response measures, and the progress of vaccination campaigns. The ultimate goal is to create an interactive and dynamic Excel dashboard that visualizes these aspects effectively, making the data accessible and understandable. This dashboard will serve as a crucial tool for visual storytelling, trend analysis, and strategic planning, enabling a data-driven approach to managing and mitigating the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

**About Data :** There are three datasets which contain vaccination,statewise testing and covid_19 cases of all states.

**Data Preprocessing :** There are null values in covid_19 dataset.In Statewise testing details there are more than 5000 missing values in two columns which are positive and negative.In the Statewise testing dataset there is lot of information missing. So merging two datasets can lead to misinterpretation. In vaccine data there are only 7000 rows which is way lesser than covid_19 dataset which has 17000 rows.Merging this datasets will leads to wrong insight. So analysis of individual datasets is preferred.

## Actionable Insights :
There was a significant surge in daily COVID-19 cases during the second wave, peaking in May 2021, which saw a much higher number of cases compared to the first wave in 2020.
The recovery rate steadily improved over time, reaching above 95% by late 2021, indicating better healthcare management and availability of treatment.
Maharashtra, Kerala, and Karnataka were consistently among the states with the highest number of cases and fatalities. Maharashtra was especially affected during both waves, often leading the country in daily case counts.
States like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, despite their large populations, showed lower reported case numbers, which might indicate underreporting due to limited testing capacity in rural areas.
**Impact : **
The pandemic led to substantial economic disruption, with significant job losses in sectors like tourism, retail, and manufacturing. The informal sector, which employs a large portion of the population, was particularly hard hit.
There was a noticeable increase in mental health issues reported during the lockdown periods, with many facing anxiety, stress, and other psychological challenges due to isolation and economic uncertainty.
